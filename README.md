# Try Out Development Containers: Go

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section. 

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "Go" sample, wait for the container to start and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
   
## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `server.go`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `server.go`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 22).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   - Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:9000` and note you can connect to the server in the container.
4. **Forward another port:**
   - Stop debugging and remove the breakpoint.
   - Open `server.go`
   - Change the server port to 5000. (`portNumber := "5000"`)
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Forward a Port** command.
   - Select port 5000.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.
5. **Refactoring - rename:**
    - Open `hello.go`, select method name `Hello` press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Rename Symbol** command.
6. **Refactoring - extract:**
   - Open `hello.go` and select string, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Extract to variable** command.
   - Open `hello.go` and select line with return statement, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Extract to function** command.
7. **Generate tests:**
    - Open `hello.go` and press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Generate Unit Tests For File** command.
    - Implement a test case: Open file `hello_test.go` and edit the line with the `TODO` comment: `{"hello without name", "Hello, "},` 
    - You can toggle between implementation file and test file with press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Toggle Test File**
    - Tests can also run as benchmarks: Open file `hello_test.go`, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Benchmark File**
8. **Stub generation:** ( [details](https://github.com/josharian/impl))
   - define a struct `type mock struct {}`, enter a new line , press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Generate interface stubs** command.
   - edit command `m *mock http.ResponseWriter`
9. **Fill structs:** ([details](https://github.com/davidrjenni/reftools/tree/master/cmd/fillstruct))
   - Open `hello.go` and select `User{}` of variable asignment, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Fill struct** command.
10. **Add json tags to structs:** ([details](https://github.com/fatih/gomodifytags))
   - Open `hello.go` and go with cursor in to a struct, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Go: Add Tags To Struct Fields** command.
